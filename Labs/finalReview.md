* Classes and Objects
    * Difference between primitives and objects.
    * Difference between static and non-static variables and methods.
    * Know how to define a class.
    * Polymorphism: remember Dynamic Method Dispath!
    * Understand the different protection levels: `public`, `protected`, `private`, and `package` (default).
    * Understand the use of the `this` keyword.
* Inheritence
    * Understand what variables and methods a derived class has access to from its super class.
    * Understand the use of the `super` keyword.
