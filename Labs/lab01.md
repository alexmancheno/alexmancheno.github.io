## Logging in to the lab computers
Your account name should be the first two letters of your last name followed by the first two letters for your first name, followed by the last 4 digits of your CUNYFirst ID, all lower case. For example, Chris Smith with CUNYFirstID 12345678 would log in as smch6789. Your initial password is the your CUNYFirst ID. Change this password as soon as you log in.

## Your Blackboard Email Address
Check your email address on Bb to make sure it is valid and it is an email address you use (of course, the college prefers it be your QC email address.) To check your email address:

Update your email address if necessary.
To update your email address:
Home Tab > Update Email > [type in your email address]
Note: The system will force this to be a CUNY email address.
