1. Open up PowerShell and `cd` into your `H:\` drive.

2. Create the following folder structure:
```
lab17
└── src
    ├── Main17.java
└── bin
```
You can do so by entering in the following into the PowerShell while in the root of your `H:\` drive:
```
mkdir lab17; mkdir lab17/src; mkdir lab17/bin; New-Item -Name "lab17/src/Main17.java" -ItemType "file"
```

3. Copy and paste the code from <a href="/Misc/TODO/Main17.java" target="_blank">here</a> into `Main17.java`.
