### Textbooks
* A good first book to get started on data structures with. Mostly focuses on implementation, not so much on theory. However, some of the code examples can be overly complicated: [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 6th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Java-6th-ebook/dp/B00JDRQF8C)
* Another good data structures textbook. A good mix between theory and implementation. Code examples are in Java and very easy to understand: [Algorithms, 4th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Algorithms_4-Robert-Sedgewick-ebook/dp/B004P8J1NA)
* A popular algorithms textbook written by a professor from Stony Brook University: [The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena-ebook/dp/B00B8139Z8/ref=pd_sim_351_1/143-4479514-3439226?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00B8139Z8&pd_rd_r=41610268-750a-11e9-971b-9785a3a220f1&pd_rd_w=MhmQm&pd_rd_wg=yoenR&pf_rd_p=90485860-83e9-4fd9-b838-b28a9b7fda30&pf_rd_r=XY5ETC19MF2NN3RPFFKK&psc=1&refRID=XY5ETC19MF2NN3RPFFKK)
* The most mathematical textbook on data structures and algorithms out of the four textbooks listed here. Very thorough, but almost no implementations (if any): [Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Press-Thomas-Cormen-ebook/dp/B007CNRCAO/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3LWOY6BWDG728&keywords=introduction+to+algorithms&qid=1557702248&s=digital-text&sprefix=introduction+to+a%2Cdigital-text%2C124&sr=1-2)

### Practice Problems
* A good book to get started with practicing interview problems, and definitely the most popular one: [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)
* A book similar to Cracking the Coding Interview, but harder. Take a crack at it if you're up for a challenge: [Elements of Programming Interviews in Java: The Insider's Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Insiders/dp/1517671272/ref=sr_1_1?crid=9RI67U5FOT2A&keywords=elements+of+programming+interviews+in+java&qid=1557702679&s=books&sprefix=elemments+of+progr%2Cstripbooks%2C119&sr=1-1)
* A website containing hundreds of practice problems and other resources for interview prep, and probably the most popular website too: [LeetCode.com](https://leetcode.com/)
