# Project 4

* Here's the <a href="/Misc/Projects/Pdf/Project4.pdf" target="_blank">Project 4 pdf</a>.

* How the project should work:
    1. The program should launch a gui with no car information displayed (yet).
    2. The user should be able to choose which .txt file to open and display to the gui, just like in Project 3. A new gui should be not launched when using the 'Open' menu item.
    3. The 'Search' menu item should allow the user to enter in a car make and filter out all cars displayed on the gui with car makes not equal to what the user entered in. A new gui should not be launched when using the 'Search' menu item.
    4. If the user enters in a car make into 'Search' and there are no cars displayed on the gui, then nothing should happen.
