> Here are a few resources that my help.

### Books
* [Head First Java](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1535383671&sr=8-1&keywords=head+first+java) was a great resource for me when I started learning Java.

### Websites
* [Official Oracle Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/). This can serve as your Java reference manual. Being able to navigate through the Oracle Java Documentation is a skill better acquired early on. Many frameworks built with Java have their documenations modelled after Oracle's, like [Netty](https://netty.io/4.1/api/index.html), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/10/javadoc/?org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html), [Spring](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.1.0.RC1/javadoc-api/), and more.
